The assembler is a wip :( . You may see many bugs. 
The assembler takes x109 assembly and translates it to machine code
compile with gcc
an example x109 assembly program is on this folder.
usage
./assemble [assmFile] [programName]

assmFile:
	name of existing file containing x109 assembly code.
programName
	name of file to be created that contains the assembled instructions ready to be loaded to the emulator.
