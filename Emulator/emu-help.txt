usage
./emulator [raw_memory_file] [-d]
NOTICE:
	system memory is initialized to zeros. When the memory at 0xFFFF is not 0, the program terminates
	it is entirely possible that the loaded program never writes to 0xFFFF so it may get stuck! In this case, memory wont be dumped to a file.
raw_memory_file:
	uint16_t raw file that directly maps to system memory
-d
	dump memory when done
